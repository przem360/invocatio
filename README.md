**Invocatio** is a text-based game inspired by the dark, Lovecraftian atmosphere, where the player takes on the role of the leader of a demonic cult ruling over an isolated town. The game focuses on resource management, human sacrifices, and making difficult choices that influence the fate of the townspeople and the cult itself.

## Game Description

The player controls a cult that seeks to gain power from a demonic deity. To achieve this, they must offer sacrifices, perform rituals, and manage key resources such as food, ritual materials, and cult power. At the same time, the player must balance gaining the demon’s favor with maintaining the loyalty of the townspeople. Too many sacrifices may lead to rebellion, while too few may cause the cult to lose its power.

### Key Features:

- **Sacrifices** – Offer human lives to gain the demon's favor. The more you sacrifice, the stronger the cult becomes, but fear and the risk of rebellion also increase.
- **Resources** – Manage food, ritual materials, and cult power. These are essential for performing rituals and keeping the cult alive.
- **Rituals** – Use ritual materials to perform ceremonies that can accelerate the cult's growth or draw the attention of the dark deity.
- **Story Events** – Narrative situations that affect the game's progression, including moral dilemmas, new challenges, and unexpected visitors.

### Gameplay Highlights:

- **Resource Management** – Carefully monitor and control food supplies, ritual materials, and cult power.
- **Moral Choices** – Face difficult decisions that lead to different outcomes.
- **Endings** – Multiple possible endings based on the player's choices: the cult may triumph, the town may fall, or the player may be consumed by dark power.

### Mechanics:

- **Turns** – The game plays out over a set number of turns (e.g., 12 months), each bringing new challenges.
- **Risk** – High fear or low faith levels can result in rebellion or failure.
- **Events** – Dynamically generated events shape the game's direction and present new obstacles.

## Objective

The goal is to maintain balance in the town, gain the demon’s favor, and grow the cult. The player must make decisions that impact not only the cult’s destiny but also the future of the town.

## Sample Endings:

- **Descent of the Deep** – The cult triumphs, but at the cost of the human mind.
- **Doom of the Town** – The cult fails and the town is destroyed.
- **Silence Beyond the Veil** – The cult survives, but at the price of uncertainty and mystery.
